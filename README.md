# Airbnb Analysis

## Problem Statement

The Airbnb industry deals with data related to listings, pricing, availability, and location-based trends. This project aims to analyze Airbnb data to gain insights into these aspects, enabling better decision-making for property management and tourism.

The solution includes the following steps:
1. Cleaning and preparing the dataset by addressing missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions.
2. Developing a Streamlit web application with interactive maps showcasing Airbnb listings distribution.
3. Conducting price analysis and visualizing variations based on location, property type, and seasons.
4. Analyzing availability patterns across seasons, visualizing occupancy rates, and demand fluctuations.
5. Investigating location-based insights by extracting and visualizing data for specific regions or neighborhoods.
6. Creating interactive visualizations that enable users to filter and drill down into the data.
7. Building a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI to present key insights.



## Approach

### Data Understanding
- Identify the types of variables (continuous, categorical) and their distributions.
- Explore the dataset to understand its structure and relationships.

### Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values using mean, median, or mode.
- Remove duplicates to ensure data integrity.
- Transform data types as necessary for accurate analysis.
- Encode categorical variables using suitable techniques (one-hot encoding, label encoding, ordinal encoding).

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize outliers and skewness using boxplots, distplots, and violin plots.
- Use heatmaps to identify and drop highly correlated columns.

### Feature Engineering
- Engineer new features if applicable.
- Aggregate or transform existing features for better representation.

### Model Building and Evaluation
- Develop regression models to analyze price variations based on location, property type, and seasons.
- Create visualizations to analyze availability patterns and occupancy rates.
- Develop classification models if necessary for additional insights.

### Model Deployment
- Use Streamlit to create an interactive page for geospatial visualization and data exploration.
- Allow input for each column value to explore different scenarios and predictions.
- Apply the same preprocessing steps used during model training.
- Predict and display the output on interactive maps and charts.

### Model Storage
- Use Pickle to save and load models (encoders, scalers, ML models).
